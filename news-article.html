            <h1>WHAT AGE DOES A CAR BECOME CLASSIC?</h1>
            <img src="img/green.jpeg" alt="" height="100px">
            <p>Is your ‘classic car’ your pride and joy? Is it a genuine classic or are you talking about that rusty
                old banger in the garage? Well, you might be surprised to learn that even if it’s a dodgy tin can on
                wheels, it could still be a classic. That’s because the definition is pretty fluid, depending on who you ask.

                <strong>WHEN DOES AN OLD CAR BECOME A CLASSIC CAR?</strong>
                In truth, there’s not really a definitive answer. Some enthusiasts think classic cars have timeless design,
                technological or nostalgic value, and embrace the idea of modern classics. But if you’re using car tax exemption
                as a cut-off point, then any car that’s aged 40 years or older is a classic. If, however, you ask HMRC for a
                definition, then it’s anything that’s at least 15 years old and worth a minimum of £15,000.
                Ask a random selection of insurance providers and they’ll probably all tell you something different.</p>

        <h1 class="title">TOP 5 RAREST CLASSIC CARS IN THE WORLD</h1>

        <div class="article-area">
            <h1>1921 Helica de Leyat</h1>
            <img src="img/heli.jpg" alt="" height="100px">
            <p>On the day that the 1921 Helica came out, the newspapers called it ‘the plane without wings’.
                Made in France and designed by the French automobile manufacturer, Marcel Leyat,
                the 1921 Helica is famous for its extraordinary looks and originality. What makes this car absolutely
                unique is that it is powered by a huge propeller that resembles that of an aircraft, rather than a normal engine.
                Even though Marcel Leyat kept working on the model for a few years, only 30 of this 1921 Helica model were produced
                because of the model’s unusual appearance and dangerously high speed.
                Currently all of the remaining Helicas are a part of private collections.</p>

            <h1>WHAT AGE DOES A CAR BECOME CLASSIC?</h1>
            <img src="img/tal.jpg" alt="" height="100px">
            <p>Talbot is a car manufacturing company with a rather controversial story.
                Throughout the years from 1903 until 1994, the company went though the hands of various owners,
                including Peugeot and Chrysler. For 18 years (1960-1978) no cars were produced under the company’s
                name and it was on the verge of bankruptcy numerous times. Talbot is well known for producing both
                vehicles for daily use and some cars for Formula 1. In 1981 Talbot was the first prize winner of the World Rally Championship.
                But out of Talbot’s infamous history of car production came a real gem called the Lago Grand Sport. Introduced in 1948,
                the Talbot Lago Grand Sport had two versions – a racing and a luxury one. Only 12 cars from the luxury version were ever manufactured,
                which makes this vehicle extremely scarce and therefore of high interest among classic car lovers and collectors.</p>

        <h1 class="title"> Porsche 916</h1>

        <div class="article-area">
            <h1> Porsche 916</h1>
            <img src="img/por.jpg" alt="" height="100px">
            <p>The Porsche 916 can definitely be called Porsche’s hidden gem. The 916 is Porsche’s rarest model
                is in fact one of the rarest vehicles in the world today. Produced in 1972, only 11 cars of this
                magnificent model were made and they were all prototypes. This model wouldn’t have been so rare today if
                its price back then was not as high as $14,000, compared to $11,000 for a 911 of the same year.
                Porsche decided that this price tag would be too high to make the vehicle attractive for a feasible
                amount of buyers and the project was eventually cancelled. At the time, the Porsche 916 was the fastest
                and lightest Porsche model ever built, with a top speed of 233km per hour. It is a true shame for perhaps
                all car lovers, especially those devoted to Porsche,
                that this model did not make it past the 11 prototypes that were made.</p>
