            <h2>PORT DOUGLAS, AUSTRALIA
            </h2>
            <img src="img/port.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Visitors come to this tropical corner of Queensland for the beaches, the Great Barrier Reef,
                and the rainforest of Daintree National Park.
                There are various tours to choose from, including this Great Barrier Reef cruise and this
                combined helicopter tour and/or cruise,
                showing you the best of both reef and rainforest.
                You can also get a thrilling bird’s-eye view over the forest on the Skyrail Rainforest Cableway.

            <h2>NASSAU, BAHAMAS
            </h2>
            <img src="img/baha.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Capital city Nassau is a lively affair, abuzz with cruise ship passengers and locals
                enjoying the local dining and nightlife. Seafood fans should try classic Bahamian dishes
                such as conch fritters. While you’re here, you can choose to simply park your sun lounger on the white sands,
                or you can scuba dive among shipwrecks, snorkel through coral reefs, or get to know your surroundings by scooter.
                You could also try a 90-minute scavenger hunt, ticking off local landmarks as you go.

            <h2>TAMARINDO, COSTA RICA
            </h2>
            <img src="img/coast.jpg" alt="">
            <p>When you base yourself in Tamarindo, there’s plenty on your doorstep: activities, shops,
                and an extended stretch of white sandy beach, popular with swimmers and beginner surfers.
                Head to the Tamarindo Wildlife Refuge to kayak along the canals and see crocodiles, water birds,
                and howler monkeys. For a faster-paced vacation, try this high-octane zipline experience at Pura Aventura Park.
                There’s also this tempting snorkel and sunset trip, including a leisurely cruise, lunch,
                and time to play in the water, arriving back in time to catch a spectacular sunset.

            <h2>Tel Aviv
            </h2>
            <img src="img/tel.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Ancient history and modern living meet in this bustling beach city along Israel’s Mediterranean coast.
                While no day in this urban hot spot would be complete without a few hours on the golden sands (check into The Setai,
                Tel Aviv for a front-row seat to sea), you’ll also want to make time for the newly opened White City Center.
                Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus architecture movement, the museum spotlights the city’s unique
                look—the UNESCO-designated White City zone
                is home to more than 4,000 Bauhaus-style buildings, the largest such collection in the world.

            <h2>Macau
            </h2>
            <img src="img/te.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Macau observes its 20th anniversary as a Special Administrative Region of China on December 20. Since Portugal transferred sovereignty in 1999,
                Macau has established its identity as a destination with a rich culture, luxurious hotels, world-class restaurants and lavish casinos.
                But it’s looking to branch out and lure in more international visitors. Macau is more accessible than ever—unlike most of China,
                U.S. citizens don’t need a visa to come here,
                and the new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge makes it a snap to travel among the cities (though there are restrictions).

            <p>With fresh hotels (including Grand Hyatt Nashville and The Joseph), classic stays
                (Five-Star The Hermitage Hotel, led by female managing director Dee Patel, will have a year-long
                celebration honoring the 100th anniversary of the women’s suffrage movement), new attractions (like the National Museum of African American Music)
                and spruced-up old favorites (Nashville Zoo will more than double in size), Music City will hit all the right notes in 2020.
